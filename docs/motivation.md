# Motivation

Log analysis is a universially common task for developers, system administrators, and
other IT professionals. It is often necessary to search by eye through logs to
extract the necessary information, such as errors or warnings. However, log files can be
notoriously large and difficult to navigate manually, making it challenging to find the
relevant information quickly.

We already have great tools for data analysis in the Python ecosystem, and we shouldn't
have to learn enough grayscale/prometheus/loki infrastructure unique to scale up the
usage of these tools.
